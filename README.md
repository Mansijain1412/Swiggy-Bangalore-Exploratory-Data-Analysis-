# Description

The basic idea of analyzing the Swiggy Bangalore dataset is to get a fair idea about the popularity of restaurants based on ratings and widely available cuisines among all the restaurants in Bangalore. 

To start the analysis, data was extracted from the Swiggy website using a provided URL. Specifically, the names and ratings of restaurants that were visible on the front page of the website were collected and recorded in an Excel file. This allowed for easy organization and retrieval of the data at a later time.

After collecting this initial data, the next step was to scrape data for each individual restaurant. This involved reading the recorded data for all restaurants and categories, and then using this information to extract data for each restaurant on its own.

By analyzing this data, it is possible to gain insights into the popularity of different restaurants based on their ratings, as well as the types of cuisine that are most widely available among all of the restaurants in Bangalore. This information can be useful for individuals looking to find the best restaurants in the area, as well as for businesses and entrepreneurs looking to start their own restaurants or food-related ventures in Bangalore.
The recorded data for all restaurants and categories was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually. 

ðŸ˜‹ Bangalore has about 1000 restaurants listed on swiggy.

- **Observing Localities:**
    - Indiranagar, Koramangala, and BTM Layout are densely populated areas.

    - A clear opportunity arises for establishing new restaurants.
    - Leveraging remote kitchens could be a strategic approach to cater to the underserved demand.

- **Web Scraping:**
    - **Web scraping** is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. Web scraping allows you to retrieve data, such as text, images, links, and other content, from websites and save it in a structured 
      format, such as a database or spreadsheet.

- **Python Libraries: (BeautifulSoup and Selenium)**
    - **Beautiful Soup** is a Python library used for web scraping tasks. Beautiful Soup is commonly used for extracting information from static web pages where the content is embedded directly in the HTML. It's 
      particularly       useful for projects that require parsing and extracting data from web pages that are not heavily reliant on JavaScript for content rendering.
    - **Selenium** is used for automating browser interactions, making it suitable for scraping dynamically loaded or JavaScript-heavy websites.
